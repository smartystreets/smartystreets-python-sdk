        :param search: The part of the address that has already been typed (required)
        :param max_results: Maximum number of address suggestions to return
        :param city_filter: Limit the results to only those cities listed, as well as those in state_filter
        :param state_filter: Limit the results to only those states listed, as well as those in city_filter
        :param zip_filter: Limit the result to only those ZIP Codes listed. When this parameter is used,
                            no other _cities, _states parameters can be used
        :param exclude: Exclude the following states from the results. When this parameter is used,
                            no other include_ parameters can be used
        :param prefer_cities: Display suggestions with the listed cities and states at the top of the suggestion list
        :param prefer_states: Display suggestions with the listed states at the top of the suggestion list
        :param prefer_zips: Display suggestions with the listed ZIP Codes at the top of the suggestion list.
                                When this parameter is used, no other _cities or _state parameters can be used
        :param prefer_ratio: Specifies the percentage of address suggestions that should be preferred
                                and will appear at the top of the suggestion list
        :param prefer_geo: If omitted or set to city it uses the sender's IP address to determine location,
                            then automatically adds the city and state to the prefer_cities value.
                            This parameter takes precedence over other _include or exclude parameters,
                            meaning that if it is not set to none, you may see addresses from the customer's area
                            when you may not desire it
        :param selected: Used by UI components to request a list of secondaries (up to 100) for the specified address
        :param source: Include results from alternate data sources. If no value is passed, the default will be `postal`. 
                            Allowed values are:
                            all - will include non-postal addresses in the results
                            postal - will limit the results to postal addresses only
